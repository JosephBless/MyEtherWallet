MyEtherWallet is a doorway to the Ethereum blockchain, allowing users to manage their own funds without a centralized platform. - Stephen, #MEWForce

Philosophy
Empower the people: Give people the ability to interact with the Ethereum blockchain easily, without having to run a full node.
Make it easy & free: Everyone should be able to create a wallet and send Ether & Tokens without additional cost.
People are the Priority: People are the most important & their experience trumps all else. If monetization worsens the experience, we don't do it. (e.g. ads)
A learning experience, too: We want to educate about Ethereum, security, privacy, the importance of controlling your own keys, how the blockchain works, and how Ethereum and blockchain technologies enable a better world.
If it can be hacked, it will be hacked: Never save, store, or transmit secret info, like passwords or keys.
Offline / Client-Side: User should be able to run locally and offline without issue.
Private: No tracking!!! No emails. No ads. No demographics. We don't even know how many wallets have been generated, let alone who / what / where you are.
